A small project to start learning React. Still in progress.. 


It uses the youtube API v3 to search videos.

You need an API Key that you can get in https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/youtube.googleapis.com

After you have your API key, you should create a .env file in your root folder and store your api key like this:
